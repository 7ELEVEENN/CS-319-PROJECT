# Educational Keylogger Project

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Purposes Only
This project was developed as part of an Information Assurance course to demonstrate security concepts and potential vulnerabilities. It is intended **strictly for educational purposes**. Using keyloggers or similar monitoring tools without explicit consent is illegal and unethical.

## Project Overview
This educational keylogger demonstrates various security concepts and monitoring capabilities in a Node.js environment. It was created to understand potential security vulnerabilities and the importance of implementing proper security measures in systems.

## Features
- üéØ Keystroke monitoring and logging
- üìß Email reporting capabilities
- üì∏ Webcam capture functionality
- üñ•Ô∏è Active window tracking
- üíæ Local log file storage
- ‚å®Ô∏è Special character and modifier key support
- üîÑ Inactivity timeout handling

## Technical Implementation
- Built with Node.js
- Uses various npm packages for functionality:
  - `node-global-key-listener` for keyboard monitoring
  - `nodemailer` for email capabilities
  - `node-webcam` for camera access
  - `active-win` for window tracking

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure email settings
   - Update the email configuration in `index.js`:
     - Replace sender email
     - Update email credentials
     - Modify recipient email

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Security Considerations
This project demonstrates several security concepts:
- Keystroke logging mechanisms
- System monitoring capabilities
- Data exfiltration methods
- Screen and camera access
- User activity tracking

## Educational Value
This project helps understand:
- Potential security vulnerabilities in systems
- Importance of user activity monitoring
- Data collection and transmission methods
- Implementation of security measures
- Ethical considerations in security tools

## Important Notice
This tool should only be used:
- In controlled, educational environments
- With explicit permission
- For learning security concepts
- On your own systems

## Dependencies
- Node.js
- npm packages:
  - active-win: ^8.1.1
  - nodemailer: ^6.9.7
  - node-global-key-listener: ^0.1.1
  - node-webcam: ^0.8.2
